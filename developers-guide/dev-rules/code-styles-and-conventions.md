## ESlint

ESLint is a great tool for keeping the code clean and consistent, we use the [airbnb rules](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript), keep in mind that we override some rules which can be found in .eslintrc in the root folder.

## JavaScript Styleguides

All JavaScript code is linted with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).

- all pages/folders has camelCase convention except components folders are PascalCase
- The trailing comma at the end of each line or a semicolon.
- Prefer the single quote on the double one.
- Maximum line size is 120 character.


## Documentation Styleguides

- Use [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown).
- Each Component should have a separate documentation file.
- Pure functions should be documented using [jsDoc](https://jsdoc.app/about-getting-started.html)
