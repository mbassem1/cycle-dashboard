# Commits

## Structure

A single task usually consists of multiple commits, when working on a task usually it will be adding a new page, which includes the following commits :

- The implementation of the page.
- The implementation for the functionality.
- The service and state.
- The tests.
- The docs.

Different tasks like updating a page or fixing a bug usually will require a single commit or two.
